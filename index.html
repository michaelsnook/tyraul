    <p>There's only one Senator who has joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Ever.</p>

    <h4 class="text-white">His name? Bernie Sanders.</h4>

    <p>We’re so happy to report that as of today, both Co-Chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have endorsed Bernie – Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison! It took real guts for both of them to come out as the first DNC Superdelegates for him. So now we need them to know that we have their backs.</p>

    <blockquote>Thank you, Rep. Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison for leading the charge. <br><br>We know you're going to catch heat from establishment Democrats for this, so we want you to know that we have your backs, and we'll do whatever we can to make sure you're soon joined by more of your Superdelegate colleagues.</blockquote>
