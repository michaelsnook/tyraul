    <p>There's only one Senator who has joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Ever.</p>

    <h4 class="text-white">His name? Bernie Sanders.</h4>

    <p>And there's only one member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to endorse Bernie -- that's Arizona Representative Raul Grijalva. It took real guts for Rep. Grijalva to come out as the first DNC Superdelegate publicly backing Bernie, so now we're sending him this note to let him know we have his back.</p>

    <blockquote>Thank you, Rep. Raul Grijalva for leading the charge. <br><br>We know you're going to catch heat from establishment Democrats for this, so we want you to know that we have your back, and we'll do whatever we can to make sure you're soon joined by more of your Superdelegate colleagues.</blockquote>

    <h4 class="text-white">Sign the note and let him know you have his back too.</h4>
